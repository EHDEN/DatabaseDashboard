DatabaseDashboard
===========

Interactive web site for visualising database characteristics generated by OHDSI's [Achilles R package](https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles).
The Database Dashboard is a component of EHDEN's Database Catalogue and visualises the subset of the results generated by Achilles that can be shared by the data custodian. 
It allows for the upload of the Achilles results as .json files and these are then automatically visualised in the Database Dashboard component.
Its main purpose it to make the data more findable as prescriped by the FAIR principles.
Full study feasibility assessments are out-of-scope. This can be initiated using a federated approach after approval from the data custodian.
